#A local health clinic is looking to add a quick BMI calculator to their website so that their
#patients can quickly input their height and weight and be given a number as well as their
#classification. The classifications are as follows:

# - Underweight: Less than 18.5 BMI
# - Normal Weight: 18.5 to 24.9 BMI
# - Overweight: 25 to 29.9 BMI
# - Obese: 30 or more BMI

#It is up to you to figure out the calculation for an accurate BMI reading and tying it to
#the right classification

#Code Here:
weight = int(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
height = int(input("Enter your height in m: "))
height2 = height*height
bmi = weight/height2
if bmi < 18.5:
    print("you are underweight",bmi)
elif bmi >=18.5 and bmi <= 24.9:
    print("you have a normal weight", bmi)
elif bmi >= 25 and bmi <= 29.9:
    print("You are overweight", bmi)
else:
    print("You are obese", bmi)
